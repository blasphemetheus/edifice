# Edifice Research Documents

Exploration of the ML architecture landscape — what exists, what's missing, and what Edifice should build next.

## Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Architecture Landscape](architecture_landscape.md) | Survey of ML paradigms, frontier architectures, and prioritized build list for Edifice (184 architectures, 25 families) |
| [OpenCLAW Integration](openclaw_integration.md) | OpenCLAW robotics integration research |

## Purpose

These documents serve as a living reference for Edifice development. They're written in markdown so they render in both VS Code and Livebook's file browser.

## Contributing

When adding new research documents:
1. Place them in this directory as `.md` files
2. Add an entry to the table above
3. Organize by topic/paradigm, not by date
